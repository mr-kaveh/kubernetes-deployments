## Explanation on file #5

In this configuration:


. We define a pod named my-pod

. It contains one container named my-container, using the Nginx image as an example.

. Two volumes are defined:
  - cache-volume is an emptyDir volume, meaning it's ephemeral and tied to the lifecycle of the pod.
  - data-volume is a persistent volume claim (PersistentVolumeClaim) named my-pvc, which will provide persistent storage.

. The container mounts both volumes:
 - /cache from the cache-volume.
 -  /data from the data-volume.
When you apply this configuration to your Kubernetes cluster, Kubernetes will create a pod with the specified volumes, allowing your container to utilize both cache and persistent storage.
